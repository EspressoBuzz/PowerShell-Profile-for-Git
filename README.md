# PowerShell-Profile-for-Git

I got tired of typing a few Git commands, and wanted to alias them.

Although you can create aliases in Git, they would still be "git \<alias>".   I wanted to type just a few characters.  
Although you can create aliases in PowerShell, and I could put them into my profile.ps1 file, AFAIK, PowerShell aliases can't contain spaces.
  
So I made these 2 small functions.
  
Now I don't have to type these commands out a million times any more.

Put these in your "C:\Users\<user>\Documents\PowerShell\profile.ps1"  to enjoy them.
